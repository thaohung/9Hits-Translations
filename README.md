## How to get started
You may just copy the English translation and then translate into your own language. The filename should be language code in lowercase, for examlple: English -> en-gb.php or en-us.php or en.php, Vietnamese -> vn.php. etc.
The header of the translation file shoud describe details about the translation. For example:

## Note while translating

If you see some wildcards like %xxx%, so just leave there wildcards as it was and translate the parts.
For example:
```
English: Your %account-type% will expire in %days% day
Vietnamese: %account-type% của bạn sẽ hết hạn trong %days% ngày
```

You may also see some html tag on translation. In this case, just translate the inner text of the sentence. For example
```
English: <span class="txt-success">This may take up to 30 minutes, so please be patient !</span>
Vietnamese: <span class="txt-success">Việc này có thể mất 30 phút, xin vui lòng kiên nhẫn !</span>
```
